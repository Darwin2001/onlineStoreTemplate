I ran monish's test it works great.
all my changes were front end changes and were impossible to be tested.
I made a lot of changes to checkout.html which enables the user to see what their order was and see what items they purchased how many,and the cost.
you can see these changes everytime you open checkout.html and see whether or not the page is functioning 
the only testable thing available is the calculate_total_cost function
